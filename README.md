# TAADsystem
TAAD is a audio processing system developed to identify abusive, harsh and disrespectful speech in Tamil Language. Here, I upload app code only. ML algorithms, RNN, LSTM with different methodology are used for performance testing.
Research codes are lost with my laptop while travelling. I recovered this code from my front-end project partner Subash Kumar. 
We worked hard to collect the dataset and preprocess that by our own. I developed different models more 10 to 15 with different algorithms including RNN, LSTM with different methodologies. 

###check out document attached in repo for more details.
Hard part of this project is data collection - preparation and way of presenting as an web app with good interactivity than model development.

This project is done with guidance of Professor Dr.Gomathi mam.
We put lot of efforts to get done successfully. This project had lots of future works actually.

Thanks to Subash Kumar and Dr.Gomathi mam.
